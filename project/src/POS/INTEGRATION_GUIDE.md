## ðŸš€ How to Access the POS System

### **For Cashier Role Users:**

1. **Login with Cashier Credentials**
   - Go to your existing login page
   - Enter email and password for a user with `cashier` role
   - The system will automatically redirect to the new POS system

4. **POS loads** â†’ Full POS interface with all features available

### **User Experience:**

```
Login Page â†’ Authentication â†’ Role Check â†’ POS System
     â†“              â†“              â†“           â†“
  Enter email    Validate      Check role   Full POS
  & password    credentials    = 'cashier'  interface
```

### **Testing the Integration:**

1. **Create a Test Cashier User:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (email, first_name, last_name, role, is_active) 
   VALUES ('cashier@test.com', 'John', 'Cashier', 'cashier', true);
   ```

2. **Login with Test Credentials:**
   - Email: `cashier@test.com`
   - Password: [your test password]

3. **Verify POS Access:**
   - Should automatically redirect to POS system
   - Should see "John Cashier" in the header
   - Should see "Cashier" as the role

### **Troubleshooting:**

**If POS doesn't load:**
1. Check user role in database is `cashier`
2. Verify user is active (`is_active = true`)
3. Check browser console for errors

**If user data doesn't show:**
1. Verify user has `first_name` and `last_name` in database
2. Check role has `display_name` set

**If logout doesn't work:**
1. Check if `onLogout` prop is being passed correctly
2. Verify auth service is properly configured

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Test with Real Data**: Add some products to test the POS
2. **Configure Printer**: Set up receipt printing
3. **Add Payment Gateways**: Integrate GCash/PayMaya
4. **Train Staff**: Show cashiers how to use the new system

### **Support:**

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify database user data is correct
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Test on different devices (tablets, mobile)
