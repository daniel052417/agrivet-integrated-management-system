# Fix Orders Customer ID Mismatch Issue

## 🐛 **Problem**
The user is logged in with ID `50cda2bc-1f08-43c0-8a0f-611bb199204e` but the order in the database has `customer_id: "533122d6-26bb-44b3-ba7e-ac060342e9cf"`. The RLS policies were only checking for `customer_id` match, not email match, so the user couldn't see their orders.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
1. **Customer ID Mismatch**: The order was created with a different `customer_id` than the currently authenticated user's ID
2. **RLS Policy Limitation**: The RLS policies were prioritizing `customer_id` matching over email matching
3. **Service Configuration**: The `CustomerOrderService` was passing `p_customer_email: null` instead of the user's email

## ✅ **Solution**

### 1. **Fixed CustomerOrderService**
- Updated to pass `request.customerEmail` instead of `null` to the database function
- This allows the function to match orders by email even when `customer_id` doesn't match

### 2. **Updated RLS Policies**
- Created `fix_orders_rls_policy.sql` that prioritizes email matching
- Updated the `get_customer_orders` function to be more permissive with email matching
- Maintains security while allowing legitimate access

### 3. **Enhanced Database Function**
- The function now properly handles both `customer_id` and `customer_email` parameters
- Prioritizes email matching when `customer_id` doesn't match but email does

## 🚀 **How to Apply the Fix**

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration
```sql
-- Execute this in your Supabase SQL editor
-- File: project/sql migrations/fix_orders_rls_policy.sql
```

### Step 2: Test the Orders Page
1. Navigate to `/orders` in your PWA
2. The page should now show the order for `cursora.001@gmail.com`
3. The order should be visible even though the `customer_id` doesn't match the authenticated user's ID

## 📋 **What the Fix Includes**

### **Updated RLS Policies**
- ✅ Prioritizes email matching over customer_id matching
- ✅ Allows access when `customer_email` matches authenticated user's email
- ✅ Maintains security for other users' orders

### **Fixed Database Function**
- ✅ Properly handles both `customer_id` and `customer_email` parameters
- ✅ Uses email matching as fallback when customer_id doesn't match
- ✅ Maintains proper authentication and authorization

### **Updated Service**
- ✅ Passes user's email to the database function
- ✅ Enables email-based order matching

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
- User with email `cursora.001@gmail.com` can see their order
- Order with `customer_id: "533122d6-26bb-44b3-ba7e-ac060342e9cf"` is visible
- No more "No Orders Yet" message when orders exist
- Proper security maintained for other users

## 🔧 **Data Analysis**
The order data shows:
- **Order ID**: `d1306b57-15ef-488f-9925-551a0e594d59`
- **Customer ID**: `533122d6-26bb-44b3-ba7e-ac060342e9cf` (doesn't match auth user)
- **Customer Email**: `cursora.001@gmail.com` (matches auth user)
- **Order Number**: `ORD-303504-IG81`
- **Status**: `pending_confirmation`

After the fix, this order should be visible to the authenticated user because their email matches the order's `customer_email`.
